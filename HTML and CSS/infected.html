    <p>Infectious diseases are spread from person to person. In small outbreaks it can be managed in a way that minimizes loss of human life. However, if we've learned anything from the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, it's that in a worldwide outbreak without proper preparation, economies will collapse, lives will be disrupted, and the death toll will be astronomical. It is everyone's responsibility to be informed on such threats to humanity. Below are resources on infectious diseases.
