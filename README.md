### How to Run Our Project
1. Follow to the newly updated hosting link (here)[https://abbycarr.github.io/technica_infectiousDiseaseSimulator/]. This is now hosted on github, with a less integrated link to the interactive element.

If you wish to look more at our code for the project, feel free to view the source files or view our submission at [https://devpost.com/software/infectious-disease-simulator].

Our project was built in repl.it after initially starting in VS Code and continued to be built in two different repl.its during the process.

In 2024, we came back to make sure our work could keep being displayed.

## About Technica:
Technica is the largest woman and non-binary hackathon and more information can be found at [https://gotechnica.org]. This year's theme was “Expand Your Horizons” and as this group's first hackathon we fit the theme perfectly. Using our diverse experiences in the beginning levels of coding, our group managed to create a project we are all proud of within the 24-hour time limit.
