## About Technica:
Technica is the largest woman and non-binary hackathon and more information can be found at (https://gotechnica.org). This year's theme was “Expand Your Horizons” and as this group's first hackathon we fit the theme perfectly. Using our diverse experiences in the beginning levels of coding, our group managed to create a project we are all proud of within the 24-hour time limit.
