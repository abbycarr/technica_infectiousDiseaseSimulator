    <p  >Below is a simulator that utilizes graph theory and python code to document the spread of an infectious disease with a variety of user inputs. These include the size of the population, the chance of connection between individuals, the initial number of infected individuals, the infection rate, the mortality rate, and the rounds of infection to simulate. These factors are designed to allow the user as much variety in the simulation as they please. 
    </br>
    </br>
    The multitude of factors allow the user to simulate rates of infection in populations dependant on factors like masking (lowered chance of infection), social distancing (lowered chance of connection), location (number of initial infected individuals and population size), and time spent exposed (rounds of infection) as well as individual disease specifications. By allowing for a large amount of choices on the part of the user we hope to provide a more accurate and versatile simulation. 
    </br>
    </br>
    From the team of Infectious Disease Simulator, please enjoy your time spent with our humble simulator.
